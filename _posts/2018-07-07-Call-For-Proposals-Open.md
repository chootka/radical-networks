<h3>Call For Proposals!</h3>

<p>From mass surveillance to the over-commercialization of the World Wide Web, the concept of a free and open Internet is continously threatened by corporate interests and over-reaching governments. Radical Networks is a festival and a conference, designed to foster critical discussions around these issues and to create opportunities to learn more about policy, DIY networking and the future of the Internet.</p>

<p>We invite artists, lawyers, engineers, writers, policy makers, educators, scientists, journalists, community organizers, and more to present ideas in this yearâ€™s Radical Networks.</p>

<p>The 2018 Radical Networks call for participation is open to all! Proposals will first be short listed, <strong>prioritizing applications from women, people of color, LGBTSTGNC, immigrants, and disabled folks</strong>, and then passed on to a jury for a double-blind review.</p>

<p>Proposals can be for workshops, panels, talks, performances or to participate in our art exhibition. Not sure what to propose?
