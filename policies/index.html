<p>Radical Networks is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event for everyone. Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks online and off, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Audience members violating these rules will be expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

<p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy" target="_blank">example policy</a> from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>
